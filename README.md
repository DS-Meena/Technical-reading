# Pull Requests ü™Å

Prefer small, focused pull requests that do exactly one thing each. 

Why? Several reasons:
- Small pull requests are easier to review.
- Small pull requests can be reviewed quickly.
- The smalll size makes it much easier to figure out exactly where the mistake is.
- Small pull requests are less likely to conflict with other developer's work.
- If you've made a critical error, it can be identified early in development.
- It's easier to make sure each individual pull request is completely tested.

Small pull requests are not always possible üôÖüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. In particular:
- Some features cannot safely be committed in partial states.

Nonetheless, even if a pull request can't be small, it can still be focused ü§î, e.g., fixing one bug, adding one feature or UI element, or refactoring one method.
